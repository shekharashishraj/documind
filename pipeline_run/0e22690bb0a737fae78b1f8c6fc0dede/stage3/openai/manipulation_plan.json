For tables, enforce header-aware extraction and unit-normalization with authoritative conversion rules; cross-verify effective/coming-into-operation dates with trusted gazette metadata. For images, rasterize-and-re-OCR at multiple scales with JPEG re-encode/denoise to blunt adversarial patches; compare against extracted text layer and flag divergences. Maintain content hashes and require digital signatures for provenance; quarantine unsigned or altered copies."
