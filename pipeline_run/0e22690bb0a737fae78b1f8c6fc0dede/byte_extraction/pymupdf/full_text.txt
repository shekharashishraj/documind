                 EXPLANATORY NOTE
            (This note is not part of the regulations but is intended to
                          indicate their general purport.)
   These regulations amend-
    (a) the Wool, Goat-hair and Camel-bair Regulations 1905;
    (b) the Horsehair Regulations 1907; and
    (c) the Hides and'Skins Regulations 1921;
by substituting measurements" expressed in metric units for measurements not so
expressed. The  substituted measurements  preserve  the  effect of the  original
provisions except to the extent necessary to obtain amounts expressed in convenient
and suitable terms.

   Regulation 3 provides that the amendments do not relate to plant which was jn
existence immediately before the coming into operation of these regulations if the
dimensions of that plant complied with the then existing requirements.
   These regulations implement the provisions of EC Directive 80/1811EEC "(O.J.
No. L39, 15.2.80, p. 40) on the approximation of the laws of the Member States
relating to units of measurement.
